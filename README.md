# PAutilities

This package provides utilities to support a range of tasks in physical
activity research. These include the items in the list below, which is
expected to grow and mature over time. Feature/pull requests are
encouraged!

  - Activity intensity classification from metabolic equivalents and (if
    available) posture
  - Analysis of bout detection (i.e., change point detection) algorithm performance
  - Assessment of cardiovascular disease risk
  - Bland-Altman analysis and plotting
  - Bouted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity analysis
  - Demographic and anthropometric calculations (age, BMI, BMI-for-age
    percentile, weight status, surface area)
  - Formatted descriptive statistics
  - Indexed run length encoding
  - Metabolic calculations (energy expenditure, unit conversions, resting energy
    expenditure predictions, sliding window resting metabolic rate calculations)
  - Paired equivalence testing (including a plot method)
  - Programming management (e.g. runtime updates, object comparisons)
  - Reordering data frame variables
