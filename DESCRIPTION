Description: Functions that support a broad range of common tasks in physical
    activity research, including but not limited to creation of Bland-Altman
    plots (<doi:10.1136/bmj.313.7049.106>), formatted descriptive statistics,
    metabolic calculations such as basal metabolic rate predictions
    (<https://europepmc.org/article/med/4044297/reloa>), demographic
    calculations such as age-for-body-mass-index percentile
    (<https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/cdc_charts.htm>), bout analysis of
    moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (<doi:10.1123/jmpb.2021-0059>),
    and analysis of bout detection algorithm performance (<doi:10.1123/jmpb.2019-0039>).
